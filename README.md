# Titanic Survival Visualizations

This project analyzes survival patterns from a Titanic passenger dataset using Python. It generates clear visualizations to highlight how survival rates varied by class, gender, age, and embarkation port.



## Visualizations Included

1. **Survival Rate by Passenger Class**  
   Shows how survival chances differed across 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class.

2. **Survival Rate by Gender**  
   Highlights the impact of gender on survival, reflecting the "women and children first" protocol.

3. **Age Distribution of Passengers**  
   Breaks down passengers into age groups to show demographic spread.

4. **Passenger Count by Port of Embarkation**  
   Displays how many passengers boarded from Cherbourg, Queenstown, and Southampton.

   

## Files

- `titanic_charts.py`: Main Python script that generates and saves all charts as PNG files.
- `survival_by_class.png`: Bar chart of survival rate by class.
- `survival_by_gender.png`: Bar chart of survival rate by gender.
- `age_distribution.png`: Bar chart of age group distribution.
- `port_of_embarkation.png`: Bar chart of embarkation port counts.
- `requirements.txt` : Shows the requirements needed to run this python file.
